This transfer window has produced a familiar picture: the Premier League has shopped where it pleased, with sizeable fees paid not only by the elite but by clubs fighting to avoid relegation. Faced with that imbalance, Javier Tebas has revived a message that friendly media outlets have been quick to amplify: the supposed strength of English football is a fiction propped up by heavy losses and by shareholders “doping” their clubs. At first glance the claim sounds plausible, which is why it spreads. But it confuses the snapshot of a single profit-and-loss statement with the economics of a sector which, in England, is in an investment cycle supported by clear rules and willing capital.

In England, recurring red ink has two main sources. First, deliberate decisions to enhance the product: wage bills that retain talent, transfer fees amortised over several years, stadium projects and other assets that lift capacity, experience and matchday monetisation. Second, accounting effects such as player amortisation and asset depreciation which hit the P&L without an equivalent immediate cash outflow. The relevant question is not whether there is a surplus this year, but whether broadcast and commercial revenues are rising, whether the stadium is generating more and better income, and whether the club—as an asset—is appreciating. When that trajectory is upwards, an annual loss is the price of scaling and defending global market share.

This is the classic growth pattern for platforms such as Netflix, Amazon or Uber in their expansion phases. They accepted losses for years because the goal was not to optimise a quarterly margin, but to consolidate audience, share and barriers to entry. Professional football is not identical to technology—there is relegation, sporting uncertainty and a fixed calendar—but it shares the principle that matters: reinvest today to increase future cash flows and the asset’s value tomorrow. If global audience grows, the product improves and clubs are worth more, the year’s P&L is the cost of growth, not automatic proof of fragility.

Nor does any of this unfold without limits. UEFA now operates a sustainability framework that ties sporting spend to income on a multi-year basis and enforces it. Domestically, England’s PSR permits capped losses over three-year periods and excludes spending deemed genuinely productive—academies, infrastructure, women’s football and community programmes. It isn’t a free-for-all. There are safeguards that force prioritisation of what truly lifts the asset and penalise short-term waste. When an owner can’t maintain the effort, the usual outcome is not insolvency but a sale. The Premier League is a market with scarce licences and global brands, and there is a liquid secondary market for ownership. That churn limits systemic risk and preserves competitive continuity.

The figures Tebas cites to bolster his case—aggregate losses in the Premier League and Championship versus much smaller losses in Spain, far greater shareholder injections in England—bundle together realities that require context and set side by side two different models of economic governance: one that accepts bounded losses as the price of expanding the product, and another that prioritises controlling the current year’s spend even at clubs with the capacity to grow.

That is the real fault line. In Spain, the squad-cost cap, rigidly applied, has turned registration into a recurring administrative bottleneck. Endless arguments over what does or does not “count” add friction and litigiousness. Flexibility to invest in talent and infrastructure is reduced just as the contest for global attention demands the opposite. Layered on top is the pre-selling of future income for upfront liquidity, which increases clubs’ dependency on the centre and consolidates political power within the league office. Official communications complete the picture: “responsible management” set against alleged English excess. It’s an effective message because it moralises a technical question and promises order. But it mistakes prudence for immobility and shifts the focus from incentives to the cosmetics of the current year.

The strategic cost is already visible. Less net investment in talent and infrastructure, a marginal erosion of international appeal, thinner squads and less room to compete for global audiences. The league becomes more predictable on paper but less scalable as a business. In trying to armour-plate the present, it sacrifices options for future growth—the very thing that determines the value of the product and its underlying assets.

It is also worth tightening the language around “doping”. Putting in one’s own capital is not doping; it is the essence of risk capital. Doping would be distorting the market with prohibited advantages or opaque money outside the rules (Manchester City aside). The question today is whether capital enters within a framework that channels it into productive investment and punishes excess. In England, for all its flaws, that perimeter exists and is applied with relatively predictable criteria. In Spain, control is exercised mainly by restricting spend in advance, with wide discretion and less room for the kind of investment that actually lifts the asset.

The choice is not between spending recklessly and balancing the books. It is about what you optimise, and under which rules. A modern framework separates financial oversight from commercial strategy, limits discretion through automatic, stable rules, and protects investment that multiplies value: stadiums, youth development, international expansion and talent acquisition. The wage bill and overall squad cost should be anchored to real income using standardised, auditable metrics; exceptions should be defined ex ante, not negotiated case by case. With those conditions in place, risk can be bounded without strangling growth.

Seen this way, the claim that the Premier League “lives off losses and will collapse” is an accounting line, not an economic one. It describes a competition that accepts present-day costs within known limits to maximise the medium-term value of its product and its clubs. The Tebas model preserves the annual picture and consolidates control, but at the expense of investment capacity and future competitiveness. The underlying question is not whether the numbers add up in March, but whether the asset will be worth more in five years’ time. England has chosen to manage growth with safeguards. Spain manages spend with a comforting narrative, amplified by friendly media, that confuses bookkeeping with economics. If the aim is to regain traction, the answer is not to press harder on the brake but to rebuild the engine. And Javier Tebas is not that engine.
